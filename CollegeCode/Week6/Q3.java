/*Program 1:
The problem is quite simple. You're given a number N and a positive integer K. Tell if N can
be
represented as a sum of K prime numbers (not necessarily distinct).
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines contains two positive integers, N & K, separated by a single space.
Output Format
For every test case, output "Yes" or "No".
Input
2
10 2
1 6
Output
Yes
No
Test Cases:
-----------
1. VALID INPUTS:
a) Only integer will be given as input from STDIN.
Constraints
1 <= T <= 5000
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= K <= 1000
2. INVALID INPUTS:
a) String.
b) Fraction.
c) Negative number.
3. OUTPUT:
a) Write the output to STDOUT without any other additional text.
b) In case of invalid input print 'ERROR' to the STDOUT without any other additional text
and
terminate. */
