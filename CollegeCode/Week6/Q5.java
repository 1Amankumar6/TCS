/*Consider the below series:
1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 5, 11, 8, 13, 13, 17, ...
This series is a mixture of 2 series â€“ all the odd terms in the series form a Fibonacci series
and all
the even terms are the prime numbers in ascending order.
Write a program to find the Nth term in the series.
The value N in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN. The Nth term that is
calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT. Other than the value of Nth term,
no
other characters/string or message should be written to STDOUT.
For example when N=14, the 14th term in the series is 17.
Test Cases:
-----------
1. VALID INPUTS:
a) Only integer will be given as input through STDIN.
2. INVALID INPUTS:
a) String.
b) Fraction.
c) Negative number as input argument.
3. OUTPUT:
a) Write the output to STDOUT without any other additional text.
b) In case of invalid input print 'ERROR' to the STDOUT without any other additional text
and
terminate. */
